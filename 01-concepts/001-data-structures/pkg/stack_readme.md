# Stacks

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. It's analogous to a stack of plates; you add (push) new plates on top and remove (pop) the top plate first.

## Key Operations:
- Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- Pop: Removes the element from the top of the stack.
- Peek/Top: Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
- IsEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.

## Characteristics:
- LIFO Order: The last element added is the first to be removed.
- Dynamic Size: The stack can grow and shrink as elements are added and removed.
- Access Time: Access to elements is restricted to the top of the stack.

## Applications:
- Function Call Management: Used to keep track of function calls in programming.
- Undo Mechanisms: Used in applications like text editors to implement undo features.
- Expression Evaluation: Used in parsing expressions, like in postfix or prefix notation evaluations.
