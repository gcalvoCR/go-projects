## Encoding

By default, gRPC uses Protocol Buffers, Googleâ€™s mature open source mechanism for serializing structured data (although it can be used with other data formats such as JSON).

Benefits of protobuf
- Common message exchange description, that means that you can describe the messages that you are passing
- fast encoding and decoding
- Space efficient encoding
- Simple to write/read
- Many *generated* languages supported

## Protobuf
Protoco buffers are google's language-neutral, platform-neutral extensible mechanism for serializing structured data

## Installation

Install protoc --> https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/
```sh
$ brew install protobuf
$ protoc --version  # Ensure compiler version is 3+
```



```sh
protoc --go-out=. demo.proto
```

## Important

well known types --> https://protobuf.dev/reference/protobuf/google.protobuf/

```sh
# to generate a slice
repeated string params = position; 
# to generate maps
map <string, string> params = position; 
# to generate enum

# nesting
```
