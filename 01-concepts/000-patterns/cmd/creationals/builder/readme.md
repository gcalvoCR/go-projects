# Builder

The Builder Pattern in Go is a design pattern that allows `constructing complex objects step by step`. It is useful when creating objects that require many parameters or configurations. Unlike languages that support method chaining directly through fluent interfaces, Go achieves this pattern by using a combination of structs and methods.
