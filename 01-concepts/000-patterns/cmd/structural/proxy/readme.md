# Proxy

The Proxy pattern is a structural design pattern used to control access to an object by providing a substitute or placeholder. The proxy can perform tasks such as lazy initialization, logging, access control, or caching. In Go, this pattern can be implemented using interfaces to define the original object and the proxy.


It help us have cache.
